# Eliminating Obsolete Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Configurations

------------

## Executive summary1
The National Security Agency (NSA) emphatically recommends replacing obsolete protocol configurations with ones that utilize strong encryption and authentication to protect all sensitive information. Over time, new attacks against Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the algorithms it uses have been discovered. Network connections employing obsolete protocols are at an elevated risk of exploitation by adversaries.

Sensitive and valuable data requires strong protections within electronic systems and transmissions. TLS and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) were developed as protocols to create private, secure channels between a server and client using encryption and authentication. While the standards and most products have been updated, implementations often have not kept up.

The accompanying, full-length guidance helps network administrators and security analysts make a plan on how to weed out obsolete TLS configurations in the environment by detecting, prioritizing, remediating, and then blocking obsolete TLS versions, cipher suites, and finally key exchange methods. This will also help organizations prepare for cryptographic agility to always stay ahead of malicious actors’ abilities and protect important information.

Using obsolete encryption provides a false sense of security because it may look as though sensitive data is protected, even though it really is not. The NSA previously released urgent guidance indicating obsolete and otherwise weak TLS protocol implementations were being observed, and threat intelligence stating that “nation-state and sufficiently resourced actors are able to exploit these weak communications.” However, obsolete TLS configurations are still in use in U.S. Government systems. Obsolete configurations provide adversaries access to sensitive operational traffic using a variety of techniques, such as passive decryption and modification of traffic through man-in-the-middle attacks.

The full version of this guidance details recommended detection and remediation strategies, as there are many ways to detect obsolete TLS configurations and different organizations may need to modify their remediation approaches to minimize network impacts. Detecting systems that use or allow obsolete TLS configurations is the first step that will help prioritize remediation efforts and provide the knowledge needed for risk determinations for allowing, blocking, or remediating. Additional guidance for detecting obsolete TLS traffic, including network signatures, links to helpful tools, and sample configurations, is available at github.com/nsacyber/Mitigating-Obsolete-TLS.

All publicly accessible federal websites and services are required to use secure connections. Additionally, National Institute of Standards and Technology guidance and Committee on National Security Systems policy prohibit U.S. Government and National Security Systems (NSS), respectively, from using obsolete protocol configurations. This guidance helps NSS, Department of Defense (DoD), and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) cybersecurity leaders make informed decisions to enhance their cybersecurity posture. Since these risks affect all networks, all network owners and operators should consider taking these actions to reduce their risk exposure and make their systems harder targets for malicious threat actors.

## Introduction
Sensitive and valuable data requires strong protections within electronic systems and transmissions. Protected transmissions use a private, secure channel between a server and a client to communicate. Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)2 were developed as protocols to create these protected channels using encryption and authentication. Over time, new attacks against TLS and the algorithms it uses have been discovered. The standards and most products have been updated, but implementations often have not kept up. Network connections employing obsolete protocols are at an elevated risk of exploitation by adversaries. As a result, all systems should avoid using obsolete configurations for TLS and SSL protocols. According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum M-15-13, “all publicly accessible federal websites and web services are required to only provide service through secure connections” [1].

The National Security Agency previously released urgent guidance (ORN U/OO/800922-17) indicating that obsolete and otherwise weak TLS protocol implementations were being observed, and threat intelligence stating that “nation-state and sufficiently resourced actors are able to exploit these weak communications.” However, internal analysis indicates that obsolete TLS configurations are still in use in U.S. Government systems. Obsolete configurations provide adversaries access to sensitive operational traffic using a variety of techniques, such as passive decryption and modification of traffic through man-in-the-middle attacks [2].

Using obsolete encryption provides a false sense of security because it seems as though sensitive data is protected, even though it really is not. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) special publication guidance, SP 800-52rev2 (2019), and Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) policy, CNSSP 15 (2016), prohibit U.S. Government and National Security Systems from using obsolete protocols [3] [4]. National Security Systems are required to use the algorithms in the NSA-Approved Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite (see Annex B of CNSSP 15). All other systems are recommended to use CNSA Suite algorithms as well. Non-NSS U.S. Government systems are required to use the algorithms specified by NIST in SP 800-52rev2. NSA strongly recommends detecting and remediating obsolete protocols and, instead, utilizing strong encryption and authentication to protect all sensitive information.

This guidance document provides detection strategies that can aid network security analysts in identifying continued use of obsolete TLS protocol versions, cipher suites, and key exchanges. By doing this, administrators should be alerted to non-compliant deployments so they can expeditiously be updated or disabled. Most network security devices able to detect such traffic can also be configured to block the traffic to eliminate exposure. Additional guidance for detecting obsolete TLS traffic, including network signatures, links to helpful tools, and sample configurations, is available at github.com/nsacyber/Mitigating-Obsolete-TLS.
